This section is *optional* and can be used to provide a summary of recommendations to the IT manager regarding which controls and/or compliance best practices Botium Toys needs to implement, based on the risk posed if not implemented in a timely manner.

**Recommendations (optional):**   
\- implement the principle of least privilege and separation of duties to reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts.Perform an internal audit to assess level of minimal access, adjust user permissions and access to data accordingly.Review and adjust permissions regularly.

\- configure encryption to provide confidentiality to sensitive information.Review employee access to unencrypted information for employees to be able to perform their duties.Credit card info,PII and complying to industry standards and GDPR must be priority

\- Install an Intrusion Detection System  to detect and prevent anomalous traffic that matches a signature or rule.Train IT department if necessary and integrate with other systems 

\- Implement disaster recovery plan and backup of critical data to provide business continuity in the event of an incident.Define and review critical data and create a recovery plan with business managers to ensure business operations continuity after an incident occurs.

\- Implement password policy to reduce the likelihood of account compromise through brute force or other attack techniques.Require complex passwords( at least eight characters,a combination of numbers and special characters) and require employees to change it on a regular basis. Multi  Factor Authentication is highly recommended to add an extra  layer of security 

\- Install a centralized password management system to automate password resets and account recovery to reduce contact with the IT department.That will  increase their productivity and simplify the process for the employees.

\- Create a schedule to maintain and check legacy systems and defy response procedure.Delegate responsible persons for roles in case a problem arises.Consider phasing out outdated systems and create a plan for full integration
